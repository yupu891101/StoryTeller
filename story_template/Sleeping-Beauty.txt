Once upon a time, [clears throat] a king and queen were blessed with a daughter after being childless for years. 
[laughs] They invited seven fairies to her christening, but [gasps] an uninvited old fairy cursed the princess, proclaiming she would prick her finger on a spindle and die at seventeen. 
[clears throat] A young fairy altered the curse, saying the princess would instead fall into a hundred-year sleep.
Despite the king's efforts to avoid this fate by burning all spindles, [gasps] the princess, at seventeen, pricked her finger on a spindle and fell into a deep sleep. 
[clears throat] The good fairy put everyone in the castle to sleep too, to keep the princess company.
A century later, [laughs] a prince heard about the sleeping princess. 
He braved a thick forest and found the castle. Upon reaching the princess's room, [gasps] he awoke her with a kiss, breaking the enchantment. 
The castle awoke, and [laughs] the prince and princess, immediately falling in love, were married. 
They lived happily ever after in the prince's kingdom.
