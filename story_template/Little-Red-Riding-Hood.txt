This is the story of Little Red Riding Hood and her mother, who lived in a forest. 
[clears throat] One day, Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother fell ill, so she decided to visit her, bringing some bread. 
The Big Bad Wolf learned about her visit and rushed to the grandmother's house, where he swallowed the grandmother whole. 
He then quickly dressed up in the grandmother's clothes and pretended to be her, waiting for Little Red Riding Hood to arrive. 
When Little Red Riding Hood got there, she felt something was off about her grandmother's face. 
[gasps] Upon closer inspection, the Big Bad Wolf swallowed her as well. 
A passing hunter noticed the wolf's unusually swollen belly while it was sleeping and suspected something was wrong. 
He cut open the wolf's stomach, rescuing both the grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood. 
He then filled the wolf's stomach with stones.
[laughs] When the Big Bad Wolf woke up, it found its belly unbearably heavy and was unable to move.
