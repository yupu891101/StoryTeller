Once upon a time, [clears throat] a Mama Duck hatched six ducklings, but the last one was large, gray, and awkward, unlike his yellow siblings. 
[gasps] He was called the Ugly Duckling and was mocked by everyone on the farm, including his own family. 
Feeling unwelcome, [clears throat] he left the farm and faced a harsh world, where he was rejected by everyone he met, including a cat, a hen, and a farm woman who took him in only briefly.
The lonely and dejected Ugly Duckling [clears throat] endured a harsh winter alone. 
When spring arrived, [gasps] he saw a flock of majestic swans and wished to join them, expecting to be rejected again. 
To his surprise, [laughs] he saw his reflection in the water and realized he had grown into one of them, a beautiful swan. 
The other swans welcomed him, and he finally found a place where he belonged, no longer an ugly duckling but a graceful swan.
