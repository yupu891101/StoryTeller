Once upon a time, there was a family of three little pigs.
One little pig lived in a house of straw, another little pig lived in a house of wood, and the third little pig lived in a house of brick. 
But then, a big bad wolf came along.
[gasps] The wolf went knocking on the first pig's door. "Little pig, little pig," he said, "let me come in!"
"Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin," the first pig said.
"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in," said the wolf.
So, he huffed, and he puffed, and he blew the house down and ate the little pig right up.
The next day, the big bad wolf came knocking on the second pig's door.
[gasps] "Little pig, little pig," he said, "let me come in!"
"Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin," the second pig said.
"Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in," said the wolf.
So, he huffed and he puffed, and he blew the house down, and ate the little pig right up.
The next day, the big bad wolf came knocking on the third pig's door.
[gasps] "Little pig, little pig," he said, "let me come in!"
"Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin," the third pig said.
"Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in," said the wolf.
So, he huffed and he puffed, but the house of bricks would not fall.
[clears throat] The wolf went home and thought about how to trick the third little pig.
The next day, the big bad wolf came knocking on the door again.
[laughs] "Ho ho," he said. "It's me, Santa Claus! I have presents!"
"If you are really Santa, then come down my chimney chim chim," the third pig said.
So, the wolf jumped up on the roof and climbed in the chimney. But the third little pig knew it was the wolf and put a pot of hot water under the chimney. 
Down the wolf came, straight into the water, and got cooked right up.
As the pig began to feast on his wolf dinner, his brothers jumped out and they were reunited. And the three little pigs lived happily ever after.
