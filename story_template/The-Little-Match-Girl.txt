On a cold, snowy New Year's Eve, [gasps] a poor little girl wandered the streets barefoot, selling matches.
She had lost her slippers, and her feet were red and blue from the cold.
No one had bought anything from her all day, and she feared returning home without any money. 
[clears throat] She found shelter in a nook between two houses, trying to warm her freezing hands with a match. 
Each match she lit brought her magical visions: a warm stove, a delicious feast, and a grand Christmas tree. 
In the light of the matches, she saw her deceased grandmother, the only person who had ever loved her.
Desperate to keep her grandmother's image alive, [laughs] the girl lit all her matches at once. 
They illuminated her grandmother's face, looking more beautiful and grand than ever. 
Her grandmother took her in her arms, and together they ascended to a place where there was no more cold, hunger, or pain.
The next morning, the girl was found frozen in the corner, a smile on her face and an empty bundle of matches by her side. 
People said she was trying to warm herself, unaware of the beautiful visions she had seen and the joyful new beginning she had found with her grandmother.
